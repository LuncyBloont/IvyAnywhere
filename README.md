# Ivy Anywhere
A Blender addon for Vine-like plants generation.

### Installation:
Clone IvyAnywhere into any directory you see fit. Open Blender and install the *.py file as a addon.

### Usage:
In the objects view, first choose a object as building or stone. Then set the cursor to any location near by the chosen object (or the surface of it is better).

> ```Shift + Mouse left click``` is a good way to locate your cursor. 

Now just open the Add menu and move to Mesh sub menu, click ```plant Ivy```. Now a bunch of vines appear!

### Issues
At present, the parameter design of this generation tool is not reasonable, but because the generation algorithm uses fixed seeds to generate random, you can try to adjust some parameters to observe their impact on the generation results in real time. In the future, parameters will be integrated or redesigned to correct this problem.
